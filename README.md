# AtomQuest Goal Tracking Portal 🎯

> **Align Goals. Track Progress. Drive Success.**

A full-stack enterprise goal-setting and performance tracking platform built with **Next.js 16**, **Prisma ORM**, and **MySQL**. Designed for the AtomQuest Hackathon, the portal enables organizations to digitize the entire employee performance lifecycle — from goal creation to quarterly achievement tracking, manager approvals, and executive reporting.

---

## ✨ Features

### 👤 Employee Portal
- Create and manage personal performance goals per cycle year
- Define targets, weightage (min 10% per goal, total must equal 100%), and UoM type
- Submit goal sheets for manager review
- Log quarterly achievements (Q1–Q4) with actual vs. target values
- Track progress status: `NOT_STARTED` → `ON_TRACK` → `COMPLETED`

### 👔 Manager Dashboard

- View complete audit logs for all system actions
- Generate and export reports (PDF & Excel)

## 🚢 Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect the repository on [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Add the following **Environment Variables** in the Vercel dashboard:
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` (set to your Vercel production URL)
4. Deploy — Vercel auto-detects Next.js and builds accordingly

> **Note:** Ensure your MySQL database is accessible from Vercel's network. Use PlanetScale, Railway, or any cloud MySQL provider.

---

## 🔒 Security

- Passwords are hashed with **bcryptjs** before storage — never stored in plaintext
- All API routes validate the active session via `getServerSession` before processing
- Role-based guards enforce that employees cannot access manager/admin endpoints
- Audit logs record every state-changing action (approvals, unlocks, reversions) with actor identity and timestamps
- Zod schema validation on all incoming API payloads

---

## 📝 Audit Logging

Every significant action is recorded in the `AuditLog` table:

| Action | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| `REVERTED_TO_DRAFT_SHARED_GOAL` | Sheet reverted when a shared goal is added |
| Goal approvals & rejections | Manager approve/return actions |
| Sheet unlocks | Admin unlock operations |

---
